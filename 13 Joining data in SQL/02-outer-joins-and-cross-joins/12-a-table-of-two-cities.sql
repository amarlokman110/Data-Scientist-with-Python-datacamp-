/*
This exercise looks to explore languages potentially and most frequently spoken in the cities of Hyderabad, India and Hyderabad, Pakistan.

You will begin with a cross join with cities AS c on the left and languages AS l on the right. Then you will modify the query using an inner join in the next tab.
*/

/*
Instructions 1/2
Create the cross join above and select only the city name AS city and language name AS language. (Recall that cross joins do not use ON or USING.)
Make use of LIKE and Hyder% to choose Hyderabad in both countries.
*/
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language
FROM cities AS c        
CROSS JOIN languages AS l
-- ON ___
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';

/*

SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language
FROM cities AS c        
INNER JOIN languages AS l
ON c.country_code = l.code
