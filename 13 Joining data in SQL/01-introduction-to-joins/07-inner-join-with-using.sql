/*
When joining tables with a common field name, e.g.

SELECT *
FROM countries
INNER JOIN economies
ON countries.code = economies.code
You can use USING as a shortcut:

SELECT *
FROM countries
INNER JOIN economies
USING(code)
You'll now explore how this can be done with the countries and languages tables.
*/

/*
Instructions
Inner join countries on the left and languages on the right with USING(code). Select the fields corresponding to:

country name AS country,
continent name,
language name AS language, and
whether or not the language is official.
Remember to alias your tables using the first letter of their names.

SELECT c.name AS country, c.continent, l.name AS language, l.official
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
USING(code);
