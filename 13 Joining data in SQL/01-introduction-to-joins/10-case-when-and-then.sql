/*
Often it's useful to look at a numerical field not as raw data, but instead as being in different categories or groups.

You can use CASE with WHEN, THEN, ELSE, and END to define a new grouping field.

Instructions
Using the countries table, create a new field AS geosize_group that groups the countries into three groups:

If surface_area is greater than 2 million, geosize_group is 'large'.
If surface_area is greater than 350 thousand but not larger than 2 million, geosize_group is 'medium'.
Otherwise, geosize_group is 'small'
*/

SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    CASE 
        -- first case
        WHEN surface_area > 2000000 THEN 'large'
        -- second case
        WHEN surface_area > 350000 THEN 'medium'
        -- else clause + end
        ELSE 'small' 
    END AS geosize_group
